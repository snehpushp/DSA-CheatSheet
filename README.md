# DSA CheatSheet

Welcome to my DSA learning journey! This repository houses my notes, solutions, and experiments as I delve into the world of Data Structures and Algorithms.

## A Little About Me

I'm a working software engineer, and I'm here to brush up on my DSA skills.  This repository is my way of documenting my progress, learning from mistakes, and hopefully helping others along the way.

## What You'll Find Here

- **My Solutions:** Solutions to DSA problems from various platforms (LeetCode, HackerRank, Codewars, etc.). I'll do my best to provide clear explanations and comments within the code.
- **Notes & Concepts:** My personal notes on important data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques.
- **Practice Problems:** A curated collection of problems I'm working through, grouped by topic or difficulty.

## Why This Repository?

- **Active Learning:** Writing code and explaining it helps me solidify my understanding.
- **Open to Feedback:** I believe in the power of community learning!  I welcome any feedback, suggestions for improvement, or even alternative solutions to the problems I tackle.
- **Resource for Others:** If my notes and solutions can help even one person on their coding journey, that's a win in my book!

## Let's Connect!

I'm always excited to connect with fellow learners and programmers. You can find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/snehpushp) or reach out via email at [pushp1999satyam@gmail.com](mailto:pushp1999satyam@gmail.com).
