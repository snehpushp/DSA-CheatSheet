# Read More

Below are the topics I'm planning to read more on down the line. I'll try to create notes and include them in the project as well.

- **Hashing**: This is an important topic and stems from Dictionary and Sets internal working.
  - Collision Handling: There could be many ways to resolve collision handling, but I'd focus on Separate Chaining and Open Addressing.
  - **Resource**: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hashing-data-structure/
